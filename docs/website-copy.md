## 🏢 FOR EMPLOYERS PAGE

### Hero
**Headline:**
# Self-Fund with Confidence

**Subheadline:**
You chose self-funding for control, savings, and transparency. Your stop loss partner should deliver the same. We protect your plan from catastrophic claims so you can focus on your people.

**CTA:** [Get a Quote] | [Download: Self-Funding 101 Guide]

---

### Problem Section

**Headline:** The risks of self-funding are real. The right protection changes everything.

- A single employee's cancer treatment can cost **$500K–$2M+**
- Gene therapies now exceed **$3 million per patient**
- GLP-1 medications are adding **$500–$1,500/member/year** to plan costs
- One bad year can blow your budget and shake confidence in self-funding

**Transition:** That's where stop loss insurance comes in — and not all stop loss is created equal.

---

### How It Works Section

**Headline:** Stop loss, simplified

**Step 1: Specific Stop Loss**
Protects against individual high-cost claims. You choose a deductible (e.g., $150K). When any one person's claims exceed that amount, we reimburse the excess. You're never exposed to a single catastrophic claim.

**Step 2: Aggregate Stop Loss**
Protects against your total plan costs exceeding expectations. If overall claims spike above the corridor (typically 125% of expected), we cover the difference. Your budget has a ceiling.

**Step 3: You Stay in Control**
You keep all the benefits of self-funding — data access, plan design flexibility, cost transparency — with the safety net of knowing your downside is capped.

**Visual:** Simple 3-step diagram or animated flow

We started [Company] because we saw an industry stuck in the past. Slow quoting. Slower claims. Opaque pricing. Adversarial relationships between carriers and the people they're supposed to protect.
