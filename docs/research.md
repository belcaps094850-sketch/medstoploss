# Medical Stop Loss Insurance — Market Research

## 1. What Is Medical Stop Loss Insurance?

Medical stop loss (also called excess loss) insurance protects **self-funded employers** from catastrophic or higher-than-expected health claim costs. When an employer self-funds its health plan, it assumes the financial risk of paying employee medical claims directly. Stop loss acts as a reinsurance safety net.

### Specific (Individual) Stop Loss
- Protects against **high-cost individual claims**
- Employer selects a **specific deductible** (attachment point), typically $50K–$500K+ per claimant per year
- Once an individual's claims exceed that threshold, the stop loss carrier reimburses the excess
- Example: With a $150K specific deductible, if one employee incurs $800K in claims, the carrier pays $650K

### Aggregate Stop Loss
- Protects against **total plan claims exceeding expected levels**
- Attachment point is typically set at **120–125% of expected annual claims**
- If the employer's total claims for all employees exceed the aggregate corridor, the carrier reimburses the excess
- Provides budget predictability and caps worst-case scenario

### How They Work Together
Most self-funded employers purchase **both** specific and aggregate coverage. Specific handles the shock claims (cancer, organ transplants, premature births); aggregate handles the scenario where overall utilization trends higher than projected.

## 2. Market Size & Growth

### Current Market
- **U.S. medical stop loss market:** estimated at **$25–30 billion** in annual premium (2024–2025)
- The market has grown at a **8–12% CAGR** over the past five years, driven by:
  - More employers moving to self-funding
  - Medical cost inflation (6–10% annually)
  - Rising specialty drug costs (gene therapies, GLP-1s, cell & gene therapies exceeding $1M+)
  - Lower specific deductibles as employers seek more protection

### Self-Funded Employer Growth
- **~60% of covered workers** in the U.S. are in self-funded plans (up from ~44% in 2000)
- Among large employers (500+ employees): **~80% self-fund**
- Growing adoption among **mid-market (100–500 employees)** through level-funded and captive arrangements
- Estimated **35,000–40,000+ self-funded employer groups** in the U.S.

### Key Growth Drivers
1. **Medical cost inflation** — higher claims = higher premiums and more demand for protection
2. **Cell & gene therapy costs** — single claims now regularly exceed $1M–$3M+
3. **GLP-1 medications** (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro) — adding billions in plan costs
4. **Mid-market migration** to self-funding — expands the addressable market
5. **Employer desire for cost transparency** — self-funding + stop loss vs. fully insured opacity
